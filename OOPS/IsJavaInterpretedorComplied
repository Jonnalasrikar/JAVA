interpreter-transulates one statement at a time into machine code
complier-scans the entire program and transulates whole of it into machine code
interpreter-something slow-python,c,c++
*one statement at a time
*interpreter is needed everytime
*partial execution if error
*usually easy for programmers
complier-faster
*entire program at a time
*once complied it is not needed
*no execution if error occurs
*usually not as easy as interpreted ones

//java is a hybrid language -both compiled as well as interpreted
javafile(harry.java)->(compile)->class file(harry class)(byte code)->can be used by java interpreter

to make platform independent- byte code is used in any machine windows,linux,mac
//any jvm is used to interpret this bytecode
//this bytecode can be taken to any platform(windows,linux,mac) for execution
//hence java is platform independent

javac harry.java->complied
java harry ->interpreted
