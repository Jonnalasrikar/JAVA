multiprocessing and multithreading both are used to acheive multitasking
*multiprocessing-prforming multiple tasks at a time in os like running replit,chrome,whatsapp
*process within multi tasking

threads -hissa of process

//in a nut shell
*threads use shared memory area
*threads-faster content switching(threads interact with each other)
*a thread is light weigth whereas  a process is heavy weight

example:a word processor can have one thread running in foreground as an editor and another in the background auto saving tghe document!

without threading:main()->func1()->func2()->end
withthreading:
main()->
func1() ->   end
func2()->
