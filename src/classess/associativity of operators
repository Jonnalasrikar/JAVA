the operators are applied and evaluated based on precedence for example (+-) has less precendence than(*,/) * and / are evaluated first
precendency-which operator are evaluated first (*,/),(+,-)
associativity-from which direction-* and / left to right
highest precendence goes to * and / they are then evaluated on the basis of left to right associativity
